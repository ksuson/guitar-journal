[Verse 1]

Asus4        D           F#m    Em  B7
I know your eyes in the morning sun
            Em              B7     Asus4
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
          D             F#m    Em       F#m
And the moment that you wander far from me
         Em            F#m  Asus4
I wanna feel you in my arms again
         G               F#m
And you come to me on a summer breeze
         Em                         Em6
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
         F#m            Asus4
And it's me you need to show


[Chorus]

Asus4
How deep is your love (quick)
D
How deep is your love
Dmaj7
How deep is your love
Gmaj7             Gm6
I really need to learn
               D                   Am
'cause we're living in a world of fools
             B7
Breaking us down
                            Em
When they all should let us be
     Gm              D
We belong to you and me


[Verse 2]

D   F#m       Em   B7
I believe in you
B7            Em              B7   Asus4
You know the door to my very soul
        D               F#m     Em     F#m
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
            Em           F#m  Asus4
You're my saviour when I fall
         G            F#m
And you may not think

I care for you
          Em
When you know down inside
Em6
That I really do
         F#m            Asus4
And it's me you need to show


[Chorus]

             B7
Breaking us down
                            Em
When they all should let us be
    Gm               D
We belong to you and me
